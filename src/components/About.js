        Thereâ€™s no one right way to write a book. Some people participate in
        NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) and end up with a bestseller.
        Others start with a meticulous outline and structured plan. Some
        (usually not novelists) can get a publication deal on a pitch alone.
        This article is meant to talk through the various steps involved and
        help you decide the best way for you to write your book.
